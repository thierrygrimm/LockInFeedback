[LockInFeedBack](https://github.com/thierrygrimm/LockInFeedback) shows a Lock-in Feedback algorithm (LiF) in action. A LiF algorithm is a noise and concept-drift (non-stationary) resistent stochastic optimization method for sequential experiments. 

## Organization
### Foundations 

**What is a lock in feedback algorithm?**
A LiF algorithm is a noise and concept-drift (non-stationary) resistent stochastic optimization method for sequential experiments. 

**What are its properties?**
adapts to changing optima (concept drift)
resistent to high degree of noise
designs experiments to gain maximal information (adaptive design optimization)
Receives bandit feedback (limited to the actions taken by the system) and decides what to ask/survey next - e.g. finding optimal prices through revenue signals in E-Tailer commerce
What parameters have to be set manually?
* Initial value ùë•0
* Amplitude  ùê¥
* Batch period length  ùëá
* Learning rate  ùõæ

**How does the algorithm work?**
Discrete oscillations around a central value x0 as input for the experiments, observing the response y. If y in phase with oscillations around x increase xt, out of phase decrease xt

## Sections
### Illustrative Example
We introduce LiF with a simple parabolic function with a maximum at x=6 with added gaussian noise. The LiF updates are performed in batches of batch length T.

The algorithm converges to the right value as long as the amplitude is set accordingly.

### Dichotomous functions
In real-life signals and responses are often dichotomous (binary) such as with purchase decisions. Either a purchase is made or its not. LiF also converges in dichotomous scenarios such as for optimizing revenue by finding an optimal price. Here the purchase decision can only be binary.

### Non-stationary Optima (concept drift)
In the real world, there must not be a single fixed optimum. Optima can be non-stationary. This is also known as concept-drift. LiF can handle it very well.
